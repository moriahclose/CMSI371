            <div class="question">What does Bezier Curve guarantee that Chaikin does not?</div>
                <div class="answer" id="answer8">Bezier's Curve guarantees that the first and last control points and last computed midpoint will all appear on the final curve.</div>

            <div class="question">As we approach the limit of the number of iterations for Chaiking Curves, why do the points generated eventually converge to those of Bezier Curves?</div>
                <div class="answer" id="answer10">Since the algorithm foms new points from the 1/4 and 3/4 marks between a pair of points, as time approaches the limit, we converge to the midpoint of the original line segment, which is what Bezier's algorithm originally calculates.</div>

            <div class="question">For three points, we notice that Bezier curve actually describes a triangle. What is the name of this coordinate system and the type of polynomials we must use for its coefficients? What constraints must we set for its parameter in order to properly describe the plane?</div>
                <div class="answer" id="answer12">
                    The answers to this question all refer to the equation <b>p = (1-t)<sup>2</sup>p<sub>0</sub> + 2t(1-t)p<sub>1</sub> + t<sup>2</sup>p<sub>2</sub></b></br></br>
                    <b>Barycentric Coordinates:</b> coordinates that represent any triangle given three points</br></br>
                    <b>Bernstein Polynomials:</b> polynomial in which curve is bounded within p<sub>0</sub>, p<sub>1</sub>, and p<sub>2</sub> meaning that <i>t</i> must satisfy the constraint t &#8712; [0,1]</br></br>
                    The parameters of a Bernstein Polynomial must all add up to 1.

            <div class="question">We have seen the recursive formula of a 3 point Bezier Curve generalize to a quadratic equation, how should higher order (more points) Bezier Curves generalize mathematically?</div>
                <div class="answer" id="answer14">Bezier curves arrive at higher order Bernstein polynomials (e.g., for 27 points, we will get an order 26 Bernstein polynomial).</div>

        <h2 class="subtitle">2D Transformations</h2>
            <div class="question">How can we define a point in 2D as a linear combination of its coordinates with respect to the origin?</div>

                </div>

            <div class="question">Why do we need to center ourselves at the origin when doing scaling and rotations when this is not necessary for translation?</div>
                <div class="answer" id="answer19">This is necessary only for scaling and rotation, because these two operations occur relative to the object frame, while translation happens with respect to the world frame.</div>

            <div class="question">How can we perform a rotation about an arbitrary point?</div>
                <div class="answer" id="answer21">

                <div class="answer" id="answer26">Homogeneous coordinates allow us to account for the origin while calculating our transformations.</div>

            <div class="question">How can we define a point in 3D as a linear combination of its coordinates with respect to any coordinate frame?</div>
                <div class="answer" id="answer28">P = x &#8407;v + y &#8407u + z &#8407w + &#981;</br>
                    where p = (x,y,z), and &#8407;v, &#8407;y, &#8407;w are the horizontal, vertical, and outgoing axes respectively.</br></br>
                    This is derived from the dot product [u v w &#981;] and [x y z 1]

                <div class="answer" id="answer33">The rays flip onto the film, so the resulting image is rotated 180&#176;.</div>

            <div class="question">Given a point, a center of attention, and the field of view alpha, how can we derive the camera coordinate frame?</div>
                <div class="answer" id="answer35">We need 3 axes and an origin.</br></br>
                    <b>origin:</b> camera</br>

            <div class="question">There exists two important frames of reference, the world frame and the camera frame. What do we need to do in order to generate  camera and its coordinate frame?</div>
                <div class="answer" id="answer37"> We need the point of origin (the camera), we need the axis defined by the vector pointing from the camera to the center of attention, w, the axis created from the cross product of w with <0,1,0>, u, and the axis created from the cross product of w and u, v.</div>

            <div class="question">We notice a strange phenomenon where the camera actually points towards the negative z-axis, how did we derive this intuition?</div>
                <div class="answer" id="answer39">By convention, into the paper is the negative direction, therefore outward is positive.</div>

Describe the intuition behind theprojection and the corner case (suppose that we live in the negative axis of thedimension we want to project) and how this helps preserve perspective.</div>
                <div class="answer" id="answer44">We can project to a lower dimension by dividing all the elements in a matrix by that of the highest dimension. Since this is a linear conversion, the ratios are preserved, thus preserving the persepctive.</div>

            <div class="question">In order to generate realistic images, we tried several different ways to map our 4 dimensional vectors (x, y, z, w) in projective space to 3 dimensions (x, y, z) Cartesian space.

                <div class="answer" id="answer46">In order to project from 4D to 3D space, divide all components by w. Likewise, in order to project from 3D space to 2D divide all components by z.</br></br>

                        <li>This will give us (0, tan(&#x3b1;/2), 1). Since we are off by tan(&#x3b1;/2), we know that the first two elements on the diagonal must be cot(&#x3b1;/2) to account for the offset.</li>

                    To do this we need a <b>Camera Transform</b> Matrix, <b>C</b>. We can derive this matrix starting with the assumption of our Cartesian axes: x = <1,0,0>, y = <0, 1, 0>, and z = <0,0,1>.</br>
                    We also know that our Cartesian Transform will look something like
